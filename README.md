# piStar - online iStar modelling for Awareness

 This is an open-source goal modelling tool. Its key distinguishing characteristics are:
  - it runs entirely on the browser, thus no installation needed
  - high visual fidelity (we want your diagrams to be pretty, even when printed)
  - supports the [iStar 1.0 standard](http://www-di.inf.puc-rio.br/~julio/tese-herbet.pdf) Pag.63
  - supports modelling awareness NFR, using the [Souza, 14] approach on his [PhD Thesis](http://www-di.inf.puc-rio.br/~julio/tese-herbet.pdf) pag.83

Currently, our version of the [original project](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~jhcp/pistar/) is deployed at http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~rportugal/piStar/tool/
